# Last.fm-Twitter
This is a script used to post someone's last.fm listening history onto twitter!

This project will no longer be maintaned or edited because of the paywall put behind the usage of the Twitter API.

## Running the program

To run this program, I used pythonanywhere.com, all you have to do is upload the main.py file onto the site, set the script to be run every day, and it is all set! You can see the script at work at https://twitter.com/rypymus
